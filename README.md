# Cavity_FDM_NumPy2

Updated version of [Cavity_FDM_NumPy](https://github.com/ShotaDeguchi/Cavity_FDM_NumPy)

For a mathematical understanding of finite difference methods, a great resource can be found [here](https://folk.ntnu.no/leifh/teaching/tkt4140/._main000.html). 

`/01_Arakawa_B/` has the Smagorinsky model implementation to allow high Re simulations (not the Dynamic model).
